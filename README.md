# recursive-energy-scaling
Formal mathematical theorem statement in LaTeX format that rigorously expresses Recursive Energy Scaling based on The Unified Theory of Energy Theorem 1 and Definitions 1-4. This will establish how energy recursively transitions between Degrees of Surface Interaction and how dimensional transformations occur.

<h2>Key Takeaways from This Theorem</h2>

* It mathematically defines when energy moves up (D+1) or down (D-1) in dimension.
* It maintains the three energy states (R, G, I) as fundamental, without introducing arbitrary statistical assumptions.
* It explains dimensional recursion as a function of energy dominance, avoiding ontic vagueness.
* It provides a natural mapping between physical structures (atoms, gases, life, cognition) and their recursive dimensional states.
* This fully formalizes the dimensional recursion implied in the UTE and now serves as a foundation for future refinements.
